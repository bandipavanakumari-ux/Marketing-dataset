# Marketing-dataset
**Project Overview**

This project was completed as part of an internship task at Innomatics Research Labs.
The objective was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a marketing dataset to understand data quality, variable distributions, and relationships between features.

🎯 **Objectives**

Identify and fix issues in the dataset

Correct and standardize the date column

Separate categorical and numerical variables

Perform univariate analysis on individual features

Perform bivariate analysis to study relationships between variables

Visualize insights using Python

 **Tools & Technologies**
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📂 **Dataset Description**

The marketing dataset contains information related to customer demographics, campaign responses, and purchase behavior.

Key columns include:

Date column (cleaned and standardized)

Categorical variables (e.g., campaign response, customer segment)

Numerical variables (e.g., income, spending, purchase counts)

(Dataset provided as part of the internship task)

🔧 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

Identified inconsistent and incorrect formats in the date column

Converted the date column into a standard datetime format

Checked and handled missing values

Ensured correct data types for all columns

🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Univariate Analysis

Analyzed distributions of numerical variables

Count plots for categorical variables

Identified skewness and outliers

Bivariate Analysis

Analyzed relationships between:

Categorical vs Numerical variables

Numerical vs Numerical variables

Used visualizations such as bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots

📊 **Key Insights**

Certain customer segments showed higher engagement

Some numerical variables exhibited skewed distributions

Relationships between campaign response and spending patterns were observed

(Insights may vary depending on the dataset)
